# Task 1.0 Summary: Setup Project Structure and Base Components

## What Was Accomplished

This task established the foundation for the AI chat interface by creating all the essential building blocks that other components will use.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Type Definitions
Created TypeScript interfaces that define the structure of data throughout the application:
- **Chat types**: Messages, sessions, and streaming responses
- **Project types**: Project data, state management, and CRUD operations
- **User types**: User profiles, authentication, and theme management

### 2. Styling System
Set up a comprehensive styling system:
- **Tailwind configuration**: Custom colors for action cards (orange, blue, green, pink)
- **Theme system**: Complete light/dark mode support with CSS variables
- **HeroUI integration**: Ready-to-use components for consistent UI

### 3. Utility Functions
Created helper functions for common operations:
- **Streaming text**: Handles real-time AI response display
- **Search functionality**: Searches through messages, sessions, and projects
- **Common utilities**: Date formatting, text manipulation, and validation

### 4. State Management Hooks
Built custom React hooks for managing application state:
- **useChat**: Handles chat sessions, messages, and AI interactions
- **useProjects**: Manages project creation, editing, and organization
- **useTheme**: Controls light/dark mode switching
- **useKeyboardShortcuts**: Handles keyboard navigation and shortcuts

## How It Works

The foundation works by providing reusable pieces that other parts of the application can import and use. For example, when a user sends a message, the chat component will use the `useChat` hook to manage the conversation, the streaming utilities to display the AI response in real-time, and the theme system to ensure proper colors in both light and dark modes.

## Next Steps

With this foundation in place, the next task will build the actual user interface components that users will see and interact with, using all the types, utilities, and hooks created here.
