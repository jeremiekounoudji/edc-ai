# Task 2.0 Summary: Implement Layout and Navigation System

## What Was Accomplished

This task created the complete layout structure and navigation system for the AI chat interface, providing users with an intuitive way to navigate the application and manage their projects.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Top Navigation Bar
- **Script logo and branding** prominently displayed
- **Upgrade button** with lightning bolt icon for premium features
- **User profile icon** that opens a popover with account options
- **Help and gift icons** for additional user assistance

### 2. Left Sidebar Navigation
- **Search bar** with keyboard shortcut indicator (âŒ˜K)
- **Navigation menu** with sections: AI Chat, Projects, Templates, Documents, Community, History
- **Settings & Help section** with Settings and Help options
- **Theme toggle** for switching between light and dark modes
- **User profile preview** showing name and email at the bottom
- **Collapsible functionality** that shrinks to icon-only view

### 3. Right Sidebar Project Management
- **Project list** displaying up to 15 projects initially
- **New Project button** for creating new projects
- **Load More functionality** to load additional projects
- **Project cards** with checkboxes, titles, descriptions, and timestamps
- **Collapsible functionality** for maximizing chat area

### 4. User Profile Popover
- **User avatar and information** display
- **Menu options**: Settings, Edit Profile, and Logout
- **Clean, modern design** with proper spacing and hover states

### 5. Main Layout System
- **Responsive design** that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
- **Smooth animations** for sidebar collapsing and expanding
- **Mobile-friendly** with overlay menus and touch interactions
- **Flexible layout** that maintains usability across all screen sizes

## How It Works

The layout system provides a three-panel design: left navigation, main chat area, and right project management. Users can collapse either sidebar to maximize the chat area, and the layout automatically adapts to different screen sizes. The theme system allows users to switch between light and dark modes, with preferences saved in localStorage.

## Next Steps

With the layout and navigation system complete, the next task will build the actual chat interface components that users will interact with, including the welcome message, action cards, input bar, and chat bubbles.
