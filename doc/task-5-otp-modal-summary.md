# Task 5: OTP Verification Modal Component Implementation

## Summary

Implemented a comprehensive OTP (One-Time Password) verification modal component that provides secure email verification functionality. The modal integrates seamlessly with the authentication flow and includes advanced features like resend functionality, attempt tracking, and proper error handling.

## What Was Built

1. **OTPModal Component**: A reusable modal component using Hero UI modal components
2. **6-Digit OTP Input**: Formatted input field that only accepts digits and limits to 6 characters
3. **Real-time Validation**: Instant validation with inline error messages
4. **Resend Functionality**: Ability to resend OTP with countdown timer (60 seconds)
5. **Attempt Tracking**: Counter showing remaining attempts (max 3 attempts)
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for invalid/expired OTP
7. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during verification and resend operations
8. **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop devices

## How It Works

1. **Modal Opens**: User triggers OTP verification (e.g., after registration)
2. **OTP Generation**: System generates a 6-digit random code and stores it temporarily
3. **Code Display**: OTP code is logged to console (in development) or sent via email
4. **User Input**: User enters the 6-digit code in the formatted input field
5. **Validation**: Real-time validation ensures exactly 6 digits are entered
6. **Verification**: System checks the entered code against the stored OTP
7. **Success/Error**: Appropriate feedback is shown based on verification result
8. **Resend Option**: User can request a new OTP if needed (with countdown timer)

## Key Features

- **Security**: Non-dismissible modal prevents accidental closure
- **User Experience**: Auto-focus on input field, Enter key support
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and retry mechanisms
- **Rate Limiting**: Countdown timer prevents spam resend requests
- **Attempt Limiting**: Maximum 3 attempts before requiring new OTP

## Technical Details

- Uses Hero UI Modal components for consistent styling
- Integrates with existing validation utilities
- Follows the same patterns as other authentication components
- Includes proper TypeScript interfaces and error handling
- Uses mock authentication service for development
- Implements proper focus management and accessibility features
