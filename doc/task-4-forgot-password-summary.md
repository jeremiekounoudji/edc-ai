# Task 4: Forgot Password Page Implementation

## Summary

Implemented a complete forgot password functionality that allows users to request password reset emails. The implementation includes a user-friendly form with email validation, success confirmation, and seamless navigation back to the login page.

## What Was Built

1. **ForgotPasswordForm Component**: A reusable form component that handles email input and validation
2. **Forgot Password Page**: A dedicated page that wraps the form component with proper styling
3. **Email Validation**: Real-time validation with inline error messages
4. **Success State**: A confirmation screen that shows after successful email submission
5. **Navigation**: Easy navigation back to the login page
6. **Responsive Design**: Works well on both mobile and desktop devices

## How It Works

1. User enters their email address in the forgot password form
2. The system validates the email format in real-time
3. When submitted, the form calls the mock authentication service
4. If successful, a confirmation screen is shown with the email address
5. User can either try another email or go back to login
6. The system provides helpful feedback throughout the process

## Technical Details

- Uses Hero UI components for consistent styling
- Integrates with existing validation utilities
- Follows the same patterns as login and registration forms
- Includes proper error handling and loading states
- Uses mock authentication service for development
