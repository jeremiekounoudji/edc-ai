# AI Service Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to integrate the actual n8n webhook API with the EDC-AI chat application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AI Service (`src/lib/services/aiService.ts`)
- Replaced simulated AI responses with actual API calls to the n8n webhook
- Implemented POST request to `https://edc-ai.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/b03f3332-b73c-46df-aba1-d41a4e58db24`
- Added proper error handling for API requests
- Maintained the same interface for compatibility with existing code

### 2. Updated Chat Hook (`src/hooks/useChat.ts`)
- Integrated the actual AI service instead of using simulated responses
- Maintained the same streaming functionality for real-time message updates
- Preserved all existing state management and session handling

### 3. Updated Chat Area Component (`src/components/chat/ChatArea.tsx`)
- Changed loading message from "AI is thinking..." to "In Thinking Mode..." to match requirements
- Maintained all existing functionality and UI

### 4. Enhanced Streaming Utilities (`src/lib/utils/streaming.ts`)
- Updated `handleStreamingResponse` method to properly parse API responses
- Added support for the specific response format from n8n (`Content-->output` field)
- Maintained backward compatibility with other response formats

## Testing
The application has been tested locally and is running on http://localhost:3000. The chat functionality now:
1. Sends user messages to the n8n webhook API
2. Displays "In Thinking Mode..." while waiting for AI response
3. Shows AI responses in real-time as they are received
4. Properly handles errors and displays them to the user

## Next Steps
- Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting if needed
- Add more sophisticated error handling and retry logic
- Implement logging for AI interactions as per project requirements
