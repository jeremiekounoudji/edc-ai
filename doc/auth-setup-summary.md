# Authentication Setup Summary

## What Was Implemented

This document explains how the authentication system foundation was set up for the application.

### Directory Structure Created
- Created authentication page directories for login, registration, and forgot password pages
- Set up component directories for reusable authentication forms
- Created utility directories for validation and mock authentication functions

### TypeScript Types
- Defined all necessary types for user data, authentication forms, and API responses
- Created interfaces for login credentials, registration data, and OTP verification
- Set up proper typing for user roles including all 7 required roles

### Mock Authentication Service
- Built a complete mock authentication system that simulates real API calls
- Includes functions for login, registration, forgot password, OTP verification, and Google OAuth
- Provides realistic delays and error handling for development purposes

### Form Validation
- Created comprehensive validation utilities for all authentication forms
- Includes email format validation, password strength requirements, and name validation
- Provides clear error messages for each validation rule

### Authentication Hook
- Built a custom React hook that manages authentication state
- Handles loading states, error management, and user session
- Provides easy-to-use functions for all authentication operations

## How It Works

The authentication system is built with a modular approach where each part has a specific responsibility. The mock service simulates backend API calls, the validation utilities ensure data quality, and the custom hook manages the application state. This foundation allows the UI components to focus on user interaction while the business logic is handled separately.

## Next Steps

With this foundation in place, the next phase will be building the actual UI components (login form, registration form, etc.) that will use these utilities and services to provide a complete authentication experience.
