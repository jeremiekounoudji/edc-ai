# Document Upload Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified & Fixed:

### 1. ✅ **Duplicate File Uploads in Storage Bucket**

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` in `DocumentUploadProgress` was triggering multiple times, causing files to be uploaded repeatedly.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `uploadStartedRef` to prevent multiple upload executions
- Added proper cleanup when modal closes
- Added reset mechanism when component unmounts

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added ref to prevent duplicate uploads
const uploadStartedRef = React.useRef(false);

// Modified useEffect to only run once
useEffect(() => {
  if (files.length > 0 && !uploadStartedRef.current) {
    uploadStartedRef.current = true;
    // ... upload logic
  }
}, [files]);

// Added cleanup effects
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isOpen) {
    uploadStartedRef.current = false;
    // ... reset state
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```

### 2. ✅ **Delete Success Toast Showing Before Confirmation Dialog**

**Root Cause**: Toast was being triggered immediately after the delete operation, before the modal had time to close.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `setTimeout` to delay toast display until after modal closes
- Separated modal state management from toast notifications
- Preserved document references before clearing modal state

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
const handleConfirmDelete = async () => {
  const documentsToDelete = deleteModal.documents;
  const isBulkOperation = deleteModal.isBulk;
  
  try {
    // Perform delete operation
    await deleteDocument(documentsToDelete[0].id);
    
    // Close modal first
    setDeleteModal({ isOpen: false, documents: [], isBulk: false });
    
    // Show toast after modal closes
    setTimeout(() => {
      documentToasts.deleteSuccess(documentsToDelete[0].name);
    }, 100);
  } catch (error) {
    // Similar pattern for errors
  }
};
```

### 3. ✅ **Upload Button Not Working Initially**

**Root Cause**: Potential race condition or multiple click handling during component initialization.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added loading state to prevent multiple clicks
- Added proper state reset when modal opens/closes
- Added upload button disabled state during upload process

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added loading state
const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);

// Modified upload handler
const handleUpload = () => {
  if (selectedFiles.length === 0 || isUploading) return;
  setIsUploading(true);
  setShowProgress(true);
};

// Updated button with loading state
<Button
  isDisabled={selectedFiles.length === 0 || isUploading}
  isLoading={isUploading}
  onPress={handleUpload}
>
  {isUploading ? 'Starting Upload...' : 'Upload Files'}
</Button>
```

## Additional Improvements:

### State Management
- ✅ Proper cleanup when modals close
- ✅ Reset mechanisms for all upload states
- ✅ Prevention of duplicate operations

### User Experience
- ✅ Loading indicators during upload
- ✅ Proper timing for success/error messages
- ✅ Disabled states to prevent multiple clicks

### Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful error handling with user feedback
- ✅ Proper cleanup even when errors occur
- ✅ Consistent error message timing

## Testing Checklist:

### Upload Functionality:
- [ ] Upload 2 files → Should create exactly 2 files in storage
- [ ] Check Supabase storage bucket → No duplicates
- [ ] Check documents table → Correct number of records
- [ ] Upload button → Should be disabled during upload
- [ ] Progress modal → Should show correct progress

### Delete Functionality:
- [ ] Click delete button → Confirmation modal should open
- [ ] Confirm delete → Modal should close first, then show success toast
- [ ] Cancel delete → No toast should appear
- [ ] Bulk delete → Same behavior for multiple files

### General Behavior:
- [ ] Open upload modal → Should work immediately
- [ ] Close and reopen modal → Should reset properly
- [ ] Multiple rapid clicks → Should be prevented
- [ ] Error scenarios → Should show appropriate messages

## Files Modified:

1. `src/components/documents/DocumentUploadProgress.tsx`
   - Added upload prevention mechanism
   - Added proper cleanup effects
   - Added state reset on modal close

2. `src/components/documents/DocumentUploadModal.tsx`
   - Added loading state management
   - Added proper state reset
   - Added upload button protection

3. `src/app/documents/page.tsx`
   - Fixed delete toast timing
   - Added proper state preservation
   - Improved error handling

## Expected Results:

✅ **No more duplicate uploads** - Each file uploaded once only
✅ **Proper toast timing** - Success/error messages appear after modals close
✅ **Reliable upload button** - Works consistently on first click
✅ **Better UX** - Loading states and proper feedback
✅ **Robust error handling** - Graceful handling of edge cases

The fixes address all three reported issues and improve the overall reliability and user experience of the document upload system.
