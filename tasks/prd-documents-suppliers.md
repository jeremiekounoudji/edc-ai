# Product Requirements Document: Documents & Suppliers Management

## Introduction/Overview

This feature implements a comprehensive document and supplier management system for the EDC-AI application. The Documents section will provide organized file management with type-based grouping, while the Suppliers section will offer a detailed supplier directory with contact management and rating systems. Both sections will integrate seamlessly with the existing sidebar navigation and replace the chat area when selected.

## Goals

1. **Document Organization**: Create an intuitive file management system that groups documents by type (invoices, receipts, specifications, purchase orders, contracts)
2. **Supplier Directory**: Build a comprehensive supplier management interface with contact options and performance ratings
3. **User Experience**: Provide smooth navigation between documents and suppliers via sidebar tabs
4. **Data Management**: Implement mock data structure that can easily transition to real API integration
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure optimal experience across desktop and mobile devices

## Design Considerations

### UI Components
- **Hero UI Components**: Use Card, Button, Input, Modal, Popover, and Pagination components

- **Framer Motion**: Implement scroll-triggered animations for card reveals
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions between tab switches
- **Loading States**: Animated loading indicators for data fetching
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle hover animations on interactive elements

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile**: Stack cards vertically on mobile devices
- **Tablet**: 2-column grid layout for medium screens
- **Desktop**: 3-4 column grid layout for large screens
- **Touch**: Optimize touch targets for mobile interaction

## Technical Considerations

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Document {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'invoice' | 'receipt' | 'specification' | 'purchase_order' | 'contract';
  size: number; // in bytes
  uploadDate: Date;
  url: string; // download URL
}

interface Supplier {
  id: string;
  companyName: string;
  description: string;
  sector: string;
  domain: string;
  rating: number; // percentage (0-100)
  avatar?: string;
  contact: {
    email: string;
    phone: string;
    whatsapp?: string;
  };
}
```

### Component Structure
```
/src/app/documents/page.tsx
/src/app/suppliers/page.tsx
/src/components/documents/
  - DocumentGrid.tsx
  - DocumentCard.tsx
  - DocumentFilters.tsx
/src/components/suppliers/
  - SupplierGrid.tsx
  - SupplierCard.tsx
  - SupplierFilters.tsx
  - ContactPopover.tsx
/src/lib/mockData/
  - documents.ts
  - suppliers.ts
```

### State Management
- Use React hooks for local state management
- Implement search and filter state
- Manage pagination state
- Handle selection state for bulk actions

## Success Metrics

4. **Search Performance**: Search results appear within 200ms of query input
5. **Mobile Usability**: All functionality works seamlessly on mobile devices
6. **Error Handling**: Zero unhandled errors during document/supplier operations

## Open Questions - Resolved

1. **File Size Limits**: No maximum file size limit for document display
2. **Rating Criteria**: Rating calculation logic will be implemented in future iterations
3. **Contact Integration**: Contact actions will open external apps (WhatsApp, email client, phone dialer)
4. **Data Persistence**: Mock data changes will not persist between sessions (static data only)
5. **Performance**: Pagination will be implemented at 20 items per page for both documents and suppliers
6. **Accessibility**: No specific accessibility requirements beyond standard web accessibility practices
