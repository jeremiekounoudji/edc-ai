# Product Requirements Document: AI Chat Interface

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a modern AI chat web application interface called "Script" designed for enterprise development consulting (EDC) services. The interface serves as the primary user interaction point for AI-powered conversations and recommendations across procurement management, financing projects, legal & regulatory compliance, analytics & reporting, and general AI assistance.

The interface features a clean, minimal aesthetic with a three-panel layout: left navigation sidebar, central chat area, and right project management sidebar. The goal is to create an intuitive, responsive, and feature-rich chat interface that supports multiple users and provides seamless AI interaction capabilities.
