# Product Requirements Document: Authentication Pages

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the development of authentication pages for the application, including login, registration, and forgot password functionality. The feature will provide users with secure access to the system through both traditional email/password authentication and Google OAuth integration, with role-based access control during registration.

**Problem Statement:** Users need a secure, user-friendly way to authenticate into the application with proper role assignment and password recovery capabilities.

**Goal:** Create a complete authentication system with modern UI components that provides seamless user onboarding and secure access management.

## Goals

1. **Secure Authentication**: Implement secure login and registration with password requirements and OAuth integration
2. **Role-Based Access**: Enable role assignment during registration with predefined roles
3. **User Experience**: Provide intuitive, responsive authentication flows with clear error handling
4. **Password Recovery**: Implement secure forgot password functionality with email-based reset
5. **Google Integration**: Seamless Google OAuth login and registration options
6. **OTP Verification**: Add OTP modal for additional security layer

## User Stories

### Login Page
- **As a user**, I want to log in with my email and password so that I can access the application
- **As a user**, I want to log in with my Google account so that I can quickly access the application without remembering passwords
- **As a user**, I want to see clear error messages when login fails so that I can correct my credentials
- **As a user**, I want to access the forgot password option so that I can reset my password if needed

### Registration Page
- **As a new user**, I want to register with my email, password, first name, last name, and role so that I can create an account with appropriate permissions
- **As a new user**, I want to register with my Google account so that I can quickly create an account without filling forms
- **As a new user**, I want to see password requirements so that I can create a secure password
- **As a new user**, I want to select my role from a dropdown so that I can get appropriate access permissions

### Forgot Password Page
- **As a user**, I want to enter my email to receive a password reset link so that I can regain access to my account
- **As a user**, I want to receive clear feedback when I request a password reset so that I know the process is working

### OTP Verification
- **As a user**, I want to receive an OTP code via email so that I can verify my identity for additional security
- **As a user**, I want to enter the OTP code in a modal so that I can complete the verification process

3. The system must provide a 6-digit input field for OTP code
4. The system must validate OTP code format
5. The system must provide "Resend OTP" functionality
6. The system must close modal and proceed to main page upon successful verification
7. The system must display error message for invalid OTP

### General Requirements
1. All pages must be responsive and mobile-friendly
2. All pages must use Hero UI components exclusively
3. All pages must follow the existing app design system
4. All forms must have proper loading states during submission
5. All pages must have consistent navigation and branding

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Backend Integration**: This PRD covers only UI implementation, no backend API integration
2. **Advanced Security Features**: Two-factor authentication beyond OTP, biometric login
3. **Social Login Options**: Only Google OAuth, no Facebook, Twitter, etc.
4. **Account Linking**: No functionality to link Google account to existing email account
5. **Password History**: No tracking of previously used passwords
6. **Account Lockout**: No temporary account lockout after failed attempts
7. **Remember Me**: No persistent login functionality
8. **Multi-language Support**: English only for this implementation

## Design Considerations

### UI Components
- Use Hero UI components exclusively for all form elements, buttons, and modals
- Maintain consistency with existing app design system
- Ensure proper spacing and typography hierarchy
- Use appropriate color scheme and branding elements

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- Touch-friendly button sizes and input fields
- Proper keyboard navigation support
- Accessible form labels and error messages

### User Experience
- Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive form flow
- Consistent error message styling and placement
- Loading states for all async operations
- Smooth transitions and animations where appropriate

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Only
- This implementation is UI-only with no backend integration
- Use mock data and simulated API responses for development
- Implement proper form validation on the frontend
- Use Hero UI component library for all UI elements

### State Management
- Implement proper form state management
- Handle loading states and error states
- Manage OTP modal visibility and state
- Implement proper form reset functionality

### Validation
- Client-side email format validation
- Password strength validation
- Form field required validation
- OTP format validation (6 digits)

## Success Metrics

1. **User Experience**: Forms load and submit without errors
2. **Accessibility**: All form elements are properly labeled and keyboard accessible
3. **Responsiveness**: Pages work correctly on mobile and desktop devices
4. **Component Consistency**: All UI elements use Hero UI components consistently
5. **Validation**: All form validation works correctly with appropriate error messages
6. **Navigation**: Users can navigate between auth pages seamlessly

## Open Questions

1. **OTP Expiration**: How long should the OTP code be valid? (Suggested: 5 minutes)
2. **Password Reset Link**: Should the reset link be a separate page or embedded in email? (Suggested: Separate page)
3. **Google OAuth Scope**: What user information should be requested from Google? (Suggested: Email, name, profile picture)
4. **Error Message Timing**: Should validation errors appear on blur or on submit? (Suggested: On blur for better UX)
5. **OTP Resend Limit**: How many times can a user request OTP resend? (Suggested: Maximum 3 times)
